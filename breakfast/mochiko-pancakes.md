This recipe was given to me by Chef Derrick Lau at work. These light and fluffy pancakes are a great addition to any breakfast and can be made either sweet or savory.

## Ingredients 

Separating into dry and wet ingredients as the dry can be mixed in advanced.

### Dry

+ 3/4 Cup of Mochiko Flour
+ 3/4 Cup of All Purpose Flour
+ 1 Tablespoon of Granulated Sugar
+ 4 Teaspoons of Baking Powder
+ Pinch of Salt
+ Pinch of Cayenne Pepper

### Wet

+ 2 Eggs (separate yolks and whites)
+ 1 Cup of Whole Milk
+ 1.5 Teaspoons of Vanilla Extract
+ 1/4 Cup of Melted Butter (cooled to room tempurature)

## Directions

1. Mix all dry ingredients together. (This can be done the night before)
1. Whisk egg whites until white and fluffy with stiff peaks.
1. Whisk the egg yolks, vanilla extract, and milk together until emulsified
1. Mix egg yolk mixture into the dry ingredients until smooth, slowly mix in the butter. 
1. Fold in the egg whites until well incorporated.
1. Heat a pan on medium heat, until water quickly evaporates off. 
1. Spoon on pancake mix and cook to taste.

Recipe also works without Mochiko, but will have a different texture.
