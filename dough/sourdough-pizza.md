My attempt to use more of my sourdough starter while circumventing the yeast shortage that's currently going on during the CoVid Crisis.

## Ingredients 

+ 100g Sourdough Starter (100% hydration)
+ 300g of flour
+ 180g of water
+ Dash of Honey or Sugar
+ 1 Teaspoon of Salt
+ 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil

## Directions

1. Mix water, starter and honey together until starter is dissolved.
1. Add salt, olive oil and flour and mix until you are left with a sticky wet dough.
1. Let rest for 20 min.
1. Kneed until supple. You might need to let it rest when the dough starts tensing up and becomes less malleable. 
1. Let rest for 1-3 hours until dough rises.
1. Half and shape each into balls.
1. Cover and proof in fridge 24-72 hours.
