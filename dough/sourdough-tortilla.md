My attempt to use more of my sourdough starter while circumventing the yeast shortage that's currently going on during the CoVid Crisis.

## Ingredients 

+ 50 Sourdough Starter (100% hydration)
+ 140g of flour
+ 60 of water
+ 1/2 Teaspoon of Salt
+ 1/4 Teaspoon of Baking Powder
+ 15g Tablespoon of Vegetable Oil

## Directions

1. Mix water and starter until starter is dissolved.
1. Add salt, vegetable oil, baking powder and 120g of the flour and kneed until dough comes together.
1. Add remaining flour a little at a time until it's the necessary consistency. 
1. Let rest for 30 min.
1. Divide dough into 8 pieces.
1. Let rest another 5 min.
1. Roll out dough into 7 inch circles.
1. Pre-heat think pan on medium heat until hot.
1. Cooke tortillas on each side for about 1 min each.
